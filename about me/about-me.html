          <p>Hello! My name is Jade and I was born in Japan But moved to Washington almost 8 years ago. My hobbies include drawing, listening to music, and playing video games.</p>
         <p>I've traveled to 4 countries so far, but I want to travel to more countries such as Korea, Spain, and Italy. If you could travel, where would you like to go? please let me know!</p>
         <p>Another thing about me is that I've been a member my whole life but recently I became inactive before starting school. I came BYU not only because of education but I am here to get back to the right path. I am looking forward to 
          working and making new friends in this class. </p>
